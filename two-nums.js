// ** Understanding the Problem **

// Write a function which takes in two numbers and returns their sum.

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words? - Write a function which adds the two numbers which are taken in as inputs.

// 2. What are the inputs that go into this problem? - Are the inputs integers, floats, or even strings for large numbers?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? - Are the outputs integers, floats, or even strings for large numbers?

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the input?  - In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? - Am I labeling the parameters of this function "numOne" and "numTwo"?
