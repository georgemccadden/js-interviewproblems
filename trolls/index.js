// Problem Domain :

// Trolls are attacking your comment section! A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat. Write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.


// Example :

// The string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!" * 'y' isn't considered a vowel *
