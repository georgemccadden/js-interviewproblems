// Problem Domain : Write an efficient function that takes stockPrices and returns the best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.


// Example/Visual :

// const stockPrices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

// getMaxProfit(stockPrices);
// * Should return 6 because buying for $5 and selling for $11 would be the most profitable.
